# Zamzam-Dispenser-Monitoring

## Summary 🌐
The problems that we aim to address are the **manual checking** and **hourly tours** required to monitor and replace Zamzam dispensers. This process **consumes time and manpower** that could be utilized more efficiently. This project aims to establish a comprehensive monitoring system for water levels in containers situated at Al Haramain🌙, Al-Masajid Haram, and Al-Masajid a Nabawi, with a specific focus on Zamzam water. 

## Project Requirements  📂

### Hardware Requirements
- Ultrasonic Sensors to measure the water level. (at least one)
- LEDs as visual alert. (at least one)
- ESP8266 as receiver and senders for data. (at least two)
- Resistors. (at least one)

### Software Requirements
- Cloud database (Firebase).
- Integrated Development Environment- IDE (Arduino).
- Web Technolgies (HTML, CSS, JS).

### Communication Protocols
-  ESP NOW protocol.
-  HTTP protocol.

## How It Works ⚙️

Our solution utilizes ultrasonic sensors and ESP8266 devices attached to each container to accurately measure water levels. Then, the data is transmitted to a gateway and stored in a cloud-based database using ESP8266 devices. Each container also has an LED indicator that illuminates when the water level reaches a pre-set threshold, providing a visual alert. In addition, we have developed a web page dashboard for easy access to real-time water level updates, ensuring efficient and uninterrupted water supply management.
